    <pre id="rot1">Step 1: Cleanser
    1 Washing your face removes excess oil and dirt that can clog pores
     and cause breakouts.
    2 Opt for a gentle, alcohol-free cleanser to avoid stripping too
    many oils you need to keep your skin barrier healthy. You may need a more
    hydrating oil-based cleanser if you have dry skin. 
    When cleansing in the morning, splash lukewarm water onto your face
    and gently rub a face wash with your fingertips. Then, rinse and pat
     your skin dry with a towel.
    3 Skin type considerations: Cleansers with ceramides, glycerin, or
     hyaluronic acid help hydrate dry skin.45 Cleansers with
    benzoyl peroxide, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, or tea 
    tree oil can help control excess oil and reduce acne breakouts.
    
    





 Step 2: Toner
    Depending on their ingredients, toners can help hydrate the 
    skin or remove leftover oil and dirt.Toning is an optional
    morning step but can benefit people with dry or acne-prone skin.
    To apply, soak a cotton pad with toner and gently pat it onto 
    your face. Focus on the "T-zone" (forehead, nose, and chin) if
    you have oily or acne-prone skin. You can also
    splash some toners directly onto your face.
    Skin type considerations: If you have dry or sensitive skin,
    look for hydrating toners with hyaluronic acid or rose
    water.Toners with oil-absorbing ingredients like
    salicylic acid or witch hazel are ideal for oily or acne-prone skin.
    
    











Step 3: Serum
    A morning serum can help brighten, hydrate, and protect skin.
    Applying a serum with antioxidant properties—like vitamin C,
    vitamin E, or niacinamide—is best for daytime since these 
    ingredients can help reduce environmental and UV damage.
    To apply a serum, gently tap the product into your face and neck.
    Skin type considerations: Vitamin C works for all skin types and
    can help brighten skin and fade hyperpigmentation. Vitamin E and
    hyaluronic acid serums can help hydrate dry skin. If you want an
    antioxidant morning serum that helps reduce acne and oil, try 
    niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3). Niacinamide can also help brighten
    skin, shrink pores, and soften wrinkles. However, don't mix vitamin C
     with niacinamide—mixing makes the serums less effective.
    












Step 4: Moisturizer
    Massaging a moisturizer into your face and neck keeps your skin protected
     and hydrated all day. Moisturizers help
    increase the water content in your skin and seal in moisture.
     This is an important step to repair your skin barrier—the
    protective top layer of your skin (aka the epidermis).
     Even oily skin types need moisture and hydration to keep their
    skin balanced—reducing the risk of overproducing more oil.
    Skin type considerations: Rich moisturizers with ceramides,
     glycerin, or shea butter can help hydrate dry skin.14 If you
    have oily or acne-prone skin, look for oil-free or lightweight
     gel moisturizers that won't clog pores.16 Moisturizers
    with hyaluronic acid are great for people with acne-prone, oily skin.
    









Step 5: Sunscreen
    Your last morning skincare step should always be sunscreen
     to protect your skin from UV rays. Daily sunscreen will
    reduce your risk of skin cancer, wrinkles, and sunspots.
     Look for a mineral or chemical sunscreen with broad-spectrum
    coverage and a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.
    You should apply about a nickel-sized amount of sunscreen
    onto your face, neck, chest, and ears. Remember to reapply
    every 2 hours.
